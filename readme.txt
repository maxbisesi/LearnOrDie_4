Can't calculate Rank based on points, if you miss a question you lose points so how would that affect rank ?
Maybe a badge can be given by acheiving a certain total points. But rank should be a more complex calculation. 
A combination of the ratio of total / whiffed, total points, study sessions registerd, card sets made & shared.  
Length of a streak, just get all that data to a method and then create an algorithm for it. 

Define ranking algorithm in a strategy pattern.

You can win badges in Chum or Galley but you can only rank up in Test.

Show rankup modal if they acheive a new rank when they log out or make sure it shows next time they log in.

Only care about their rank if theyre logged in, guests don't get no rank.

Will have to persist rank state for a user, to keep track of badges rank etc. 

First define the Ranks and badges ( Can't code without knowing what to code. ):
/ may need to be adjusted / 

Recruit = < 5000pts

to gain the following ranks you must meet their listed criteria:

BucketBrigade: 5000 points
Harpoonist: 8000 - 13000 and 2 badges
FreeDiver: 13000 - 15000 and 5 badges
CageMaster: 18000 - 20000 and 10 badges
TheBitten: 20000 and 20 badges
GreatWhite: 30000 and 25 badges

Only thing on the mind of a shark is eat.
